Step 1. we have to set up a controller and model

Method 1
Create Controller and Model separately
php artisan make:controller PostController
php artisan make:model Post

* This way is not good. Because we have to create the migrations separately. The whole purpose of the Model is creating migrations at the same time

Method 2
1. Create Controller 
>>> php artisan make:controller PostController

2. Create Model and the migration together
	-m flag is to create the migration
>>> php artisan make:controller PostController -m 


Step 2. create a method in controller to view the post
PostController.php [7]

Step 3. set up the route
Web.php 

TEST http://127.0.0.1:8000/posts

Step 4. Set up the Database table
1. >>> php artisan make:controller PostController -m 

2. We need to tell the database to create the table. This is done in the migration file
database\migrations\<date_numbers>_create_posts_table.php ----- > public function up()

3. migrate
php artisan migrate
