Query builder is to create SQLs statements. We can either select a row or select the whole table.

Step 01: use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;
Step 02: write the SQLs

In this example I have taken PostController.php, index()

Example 01:
public function index(){
        $post=DB::select('SELECT * FROM posts');
        dd($post);        
    }
